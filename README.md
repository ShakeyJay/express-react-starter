# express-react-starter
This is the starting place for all of my express-react apps

To finish the setup you need to run these things:
1. Rename the project in package.json accordingly
2. Remove the .git directory and git init with the new repo
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm run-script build 

At this point you will be ready to run a blank application with:
node server.js
